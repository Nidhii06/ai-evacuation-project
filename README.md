# AI Evacuation System

This project focuses on building an AI-based evacuation system that helps guide people to the safest exit during emergency situations.

## Problem
During emergencies, people often panic and overcrowd limited exits, leading to delays and safety risks.

## Solution
The system analyzes factors such as crowd density and available paths to suggest optimal evacuation routes, helping reduce congestion and evacuation time.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Basic AI / logic-based decision making
- Graph / path optimization concepts

## Status
Academic / learning project
